# DetectionofSleepApneaUsingSklearn
The project aims to detect sleep apnea using machine learning techniques, specifically utilizing the RandomForestClassifier algorithm from sklearn and T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) for data visualization.

In this project, we use machine learning to detect sleep apnea through two primary files: main.py and datasplitting.py. VisualizationOfSleepApneaDetection.py is a Python 3.11 script designed to organize raw sleep apnea electrocardiogram (ECG) data into a Python array and save it as ApneaData.pkl. On the other hand, main.py is the main file where we implement the machine learning algorithms. Additionally, VisualizationOfSleepApneaDetection.py is another essential script used to visualize data by employing dimensionality reduction techniques.
